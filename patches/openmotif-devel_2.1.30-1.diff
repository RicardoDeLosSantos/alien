+
+THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE
+
+MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE
+
+  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
+THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
+DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
+AGREEMENT.
+
+   1. DEFINITIONS
+
+       "Contribution" means:
+        a. in the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. ("The Open Group"),
+        the Original
+              Program, and
+
+        b. in the case of each Contributor,
+            i.  changes to the Program, and 
+	    ii. additions to the Program;
+
+           where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
+           from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
+           Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added
+           to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting
+           on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
+           additions to the Program which:
+
+            i. are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
+            with the
+              Program under their own license agreement, even if the
+              separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program,
+              and
+
+           ii. are not derivative works of the Program.
+
+       "Contributor" means The Open Group and any other entity that
+       distributes the Program.
+
+       "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
+       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
+       alone or when combined with the Program.
+
+       "Open Source" programs mean software for which the source code
+       is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions
+       and for which the source code and object code are available for
+       distribution without license charges.
+
+        "Original Program" means the original version of the software
+        accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group,
+        including source code, object code and documentation, if any.
+
+        "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.
+
+        "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
+        Agreement, including all Contributors.
+
+     2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+        The rights granted under this license are limited solely to
+        distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on,
+        with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open
+        Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing
+        distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with,
+        or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs.
+
+         a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations
+         of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
+         a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
+         to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
+         publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
+         of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,
+         in source code and object code form.
+
+         b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations
+         of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
+         a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
+         Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
+         otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
+         in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
+         apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
+         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
+         such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
+         to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
+         shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
+         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
+
+         c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor
+         grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
+         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
+         not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights
+         of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
+         to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
+         infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As
+         a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
+         hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
+         to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
+         any. For example, if a third party patent license is required
+         to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
+         responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
+         the Program.
+
+         d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
+         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
+         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
+
+     3. REQUIREMENTS
+
+        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object
+        code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a. it
+        complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+
+        b. its license agreement:
+
+        i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
+        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
+        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
+        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
+        for a particular purpose;
+
+        ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
+        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
+        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
+
+        iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
+        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
+        party; and
+
+        iv. states that source code for the Program is available from
+        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
+        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
+        software exchange.
+
+       When the Program is made available in source code form:
+         a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and
+
+         b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy
+         of the Program.
+
+       Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous
+       location in the Program:
+
+                Copyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group and others. All
+                Rights Reserved.
+
+       In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the
+       originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably
+       allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
+       Contribution.
+
+     4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
+       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
+       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
+       and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate
+       the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations
+       provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in
+       a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
+       not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
+       if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
+       offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees
+       to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
+       Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
+       "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
+       brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
+       the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
+       Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
+       a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section
+       do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
+       alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,
+       an Indemnified Contributor must:
+
+         a. promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of
+         such claim, and
+
+         b. allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate
+         with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related
+         settlement negotiations.
+
+       The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at
+       its own expense.
+
+       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
+       commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is
+       then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor
+       then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related
+       to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
+       Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,
+       the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against
+       the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
+       warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
+       pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
+       those damages.
+
+     5. NO WARRANTY
+
+       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
+       PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
+       CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
+       WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
+       NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+       PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
+       the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and
+       assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
+       this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs
+       of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
+       or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
+       interruption of operations.
+
+     6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
+
+       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
+       RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
+       DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
+       DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER
+       CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
+       STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
+       ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
+       OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED
+       OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+     7. GENERAL
+
+       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
+       under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
+       enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,
+       and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
+       shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
+       provision valid and enforceable.
+
+       If Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official
+       proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with
+       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
+       or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted
+       by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
+       terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
+       if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
+       (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
+       that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
+       other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
+       then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
+       terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
+       it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
+       of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
+       period of time after becoming aware of such non- compliance. If
+       all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
+       agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
+       reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under
+       this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to
+       the Program shall continue and survive.
+
+       The Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions)
+       of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the
+       Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
+       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
+       to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.
+       In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
+       Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
+       Contributions) under the new version.  No one other than The
+       Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement.  Except as
+       expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
+       receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property
+       of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by
+       implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program
+       not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
+
+       No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under
+       this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action
+       arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
+       resulting litigation.
